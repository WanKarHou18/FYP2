# Final-Year-Project-Uberization-of-Online-Printing-Services-with-Mobile-Application
Wan Kar Hou - Final Year Project -Interactive Android mobile application with important features for any users to set up their own online digital printing service and for online printing service customers to apply those services in an effective manner while managed by admin. Software and libraries such as OpenCV, deep learning model-MobileNetV2 implemented in developing advanced functionalities of this mobile application- edit images, reject blurry image, reject adult content image and reject images that are not suitable for a certain size of printing material.

### Software and Libraries to Use:

1.	Android Studio
2.	Open CV SDK
3.	Android Emulator
4.	Firebase Storage
5.	XAMPP
6.	phpMyAdmin
7.	000webhost
8.	PyTorch Mobile
9.	Google Colaboratory
10.	GSON

### File Description:

1.	FYP2_Report – Report for Final Year Project which include objectives, introduction, instruction to setup the project, screenshots, etc.
2.	PHP	-	PHP Scripts to be used in c-panel of 000webhost.
4.	SQL	-	SQL script for creation of SQL database in c-panel.
5.	java & app – Project in Android Studio.
6.	Google Colab and Dataset– Train and built-up Deep Learning Model – MobileNetV2 for detection of image with adult content.

### Dataset for CNN Model training 

Dataset is categorized and labelled as “1” and “0”. “1” represented Adult Content while “0” represented non-adult content. In total, dataset consisted of 100 images which spilted into training dataset and validation dataset, 80 images for training dataset and 20 images for validation dataset.
